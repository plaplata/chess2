Phase 0:

I'm told to start by fixing all things necessary to
pass BishopMoveTests.

Implemented code for:
squares on ChessBoard

ChessPosition: row, col

ChessMove: startPosition, endPosition, promotionPiece

addPiece, getRow, getColumn, getPiece

pieceMoves: Empty ArrayList for now

---
ChessBoard: getPiece, addPiece altered (-1)

ChessMove: @Override: toString, equals, hashCode added

ChessPosition: @Override: toString, equals, hashCode added

ChessPiece: pieceColor, type. Implementation of bishop moves, switch

---
King moves added
Rook moves added
Queen moves added
Pawn moves added, En Passant logic not implemented, needs game state tracking
In ChessPiece, added addPawnMoveIfValid helper method for Pawn promotion logic
Knight moves added
---
Added Overrides for equals and hashCode in ChessBoard.java
ChessBoardTests now passing
---
Added Overrides for equals and hashCode in ChessPiece.java
Now passing all tests!

--
Phase 3, unit tests cannot have mockito.
